This is my Discord bot called Kelly Bot. I started development on this project May 20, 2019 and stopped development sometime during July. I plan to remake the bot from scratch with the new JDA and the knowledge I have gained from making this one.

In order for the bot to work, you must input a Discord Bot Token into the Settings.json and a YouTube API key into the YouTubeAPI.java.

Features:
- Auto References: Whenever a user in the server says something that the bot recognizes, she will reply with the source of the reference.
- Find Reference: She will see if she knows a particular reference.
- Clear: She will clear up to 100 messages in a Text Channel.
- Greeting: She will say hello.
- Help: List off all possible commands.
- Set Prefix: Change the bot's command prefix.
- Set Status: Change the status of the bot (Cannot be done frequently).
- User Info: Get information about a given user in the server.
- Whitelist: Change the role whitelist for a given command.
- YouTube Search: Search for a specific YouTube Video.
- Join & Leave Voice Channel: Have her join and leave whatever voice channel the user is in.
- Music Options:
  - Play, Pause, Stop
  - Show Current Playlist
  - Show Current Song
  - Set the Volume
  - Skip to a certain song in the playlist
  - Skip to a certain part of the song
